    <h3>Training and Debut (1991–1994)</h3>
    <p>Under the tutelage of his uncle, Dave “Uncle D” Fucky, and with support from his father, Doug began training in 1991. He was sent to Jerry Lawler’s USWA system, where he learned the fundamentals of Southern wrestling. He made his debut on November 17, 1994, at the St. Clair Shores Civic Center—an arena he would later grace for his final match.</p>
    
    <h3>PAWF and "The St. Clair Sinners" (1997-2000)</h3>

    <h3>Singles Heel Run (2000–2002)</h3>
    <p>Embracing an egotistical Hollywood persona, Doug rebranded himself as Doug Devious, complete with aggressive promos and in-ring tactics that established him as one of the most dynamic heels of his era.</p>
    
    <h3>Independent Circuit (2002)</h3>
    <p>After his heel run, Doug embarked on a journey across the independent circuit. High-profile matches against talents such as Bryan Danielson at ROH’s inaugural event and hard-fought bouts in Combat Zone Wrestling helped redefine his character and cement his reputation.</p>
    
    <h3>New Japan Pro Wrestling (2003–2005)</h3>

    <h3>Mexican Independent Circuit (2008)</h3>

    <h3>Dragon Gate USA (2009–2010) and Return to ROH/Chikara (2009)</h3>
    <p>Doug joined Dragon Gate USA in 2009, capturing the inaugural Open the Freedom Gate Championship. He also returned to Ring of Honor and Chikara, engaging in technical and high-intensity matches that reaffirmed his legacy in the independent wrestling scene.</p>
    
    <h3>Return to PAWF and Face Turn (2010–2024)</h3>
    <p>Returning to PAWF in 2010, Doug transitioned from a dominant heel to a more nuanced face character. Embracing an anti-hero persona, he helped nurture new talent while continuing to build on his storied career until his retirement.</p>
    
    <h3>Retirement (2024)</h3>
    <p>On November 17, 2024—exactly 30 years after his debut—Doug faced longtime rival Jack Gallahay in an emotional farewell match at the St. Clair Shores Civic Center. The bout featured high-risk maneuvers, including a daring Frog Splash through a table and a dramatic Devious Death Drop, culminating in a submission victory via the Scorpion Cross Lock.
